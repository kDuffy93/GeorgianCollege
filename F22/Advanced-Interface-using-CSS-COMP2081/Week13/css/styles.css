/* The <section> element in the <main> will be the grid container */

main>section {
    /* STEP 1: Set up the grid */
    display: grid;
    /* STEP 2: Let's allow the user to resize the grid container so we can see the responsive behavior */
    resize: both;
    /* STEP 3: Add overflow auto so that the grid container enables scrolling if it is resized to be too small to contain the grid items */
    overflow: auto;
    /* STEP 4: Add a gap between grid items so we can better see how the items are being arranged inside the grid container */
    gap: 5px;
    background-color: lightgrey;
    padding: 5px;
    /* STEP 5: Set up a basic grid with 2 rows and 5 columns */
    /* STEP 6: Let's optimize the code with the CSS repeat() function */
    /* STEP 7: Now change the fixed width and height of the rows and columns to fractional units (fr) */
    /* STEP 8: Offer twice as much space to the first 2 columns as is offered to the remaining 3 */
    /* Notice when you shrink the width of the grid container, there is a minimum size for each grid item? This is the min-content (very useful CSS property) */
    /* STEP 9: Let's be more prescriptive with height and width of the grid items - apply min() and max() */
    /* min() is essentially setting a max-height, and max() is effectively setting a min-height */
    /* STEP 10: Alternatively, we can set minimum and maximum limits within which the columns or rows can expand or contract with minmax() - this is a CSS Grid-specific property/function */
    /* Note that we reverted back to fr units for the rows - this allows the rows to expand in height if they can, but not to shrink to less than min-content */
    /* STEP 11: If there is an ideal width you would like to specify, but within upper and lower limits, use clamp() */
    /* STEP 12: What if you wanted the layout to feature a dynamic number of columns? The auto-fit and auto-fill parameters of the repeat() function can help - avoiding the need for extensive @media queries */
    /* STEP 13: Combining auto-fit with minmax() will enable an even more adaptive grid layout experience */
    /* STEP 14: Try auto-fill instead - the difference is subtle but make the change, then observe the behavior using the grid display in the browser dev tools */
